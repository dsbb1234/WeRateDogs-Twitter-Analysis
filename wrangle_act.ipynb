    "\"Data for this project came from the archive of  twitter user @dog_rates archive known as WeRateDogs.\"  Users send the account pictures of their dogs and they receive a witty response and a rating of the dog.  The rating ranges from 0 to 13 (denominator) and is compared to 10 as the numerator.  WeRateDogs does not follow rigid rating.  They have values above 13.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Quality Issues: \n",
    "\n",
    "##### In the twitter_archive_enhanced file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) rating_numerator: Values ranging from 0 to 1776. they should be in the range from 0-13. Need to further investigate.  The WeRateDogs Wikipedia page indicated the ratings numerator is is up to 13, however, the rating structure is not followed rigidly and is considered one of the things appealing to followers. In this study, the high rating records were not removed and the analysis will not utilize the rating information\n",
    "\n",
    "2) rating_denominator: Values exceed 10. Need to further investigate these values.  As stated above, we will not alter the ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) there are a large number of names equal to \"None\".  Need to see if we can obtain any of these from the text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) There are 181 rows that are retweets in the twitter_archive_enhanced file.  We will need to remove these.  They can be indentified using \"retweeted_status\" variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Dog's name: There are a number of records with a names of \"None\", \"an\", 'the\",\"very\", \"quite\",\"one\", \"just\", \"actually\",\"mad\", \"not\", \"officially\", \"infuriating\", \"unacceptable, \"light\", \"his\", \"old\", \"all, \"my\", \"such\", \"by, \"this\", \"space\", \"life\", and \"a\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The the tweet_id should be an object/string as it is not to be used in calculting statistics. It is meant to identify the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) The in_reply_to_status_id and in_reply_to_user_id should be an string/object, not float.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Retweet_count and favorite_count are float64.  They should be changed to integer as they are counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) retweeted_status should be an object/string not float.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) retweeted_status_timestam should be date/time, not object\n",
    "\n",
    "10) using the rating numerator and rating denominator, divide to calculate the rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In the image_predictions file:\n",
    "\n",
    "11) There are 543 images in the file that are not a picture of a dog. Need to remove these from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Dog names in column \"pl\" are not capitalized in all cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Dog names should be categorical, not boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "14) twitter_archive_enhanced \"timestamp variable is an object. It should be date/time.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) twitter_arhchive_enhanced \"retweeted_status_timestamp\" is an object. It should be converted to date/time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "16) clarify the purpose of the p1,p2,p3 variables by spelling out \"prediction.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "17) There are a number of rows where the puppy's \"name\" is equal to 'None'.  Try to find the names in the texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In the tweet-json.txt file:\n",
    "\n",
    "18) There are a number of rows that are retweets. We will need to remove these. They can be indentified using \"retweeted_status\" variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "19) id should be renamed tweet_id\n",
    "\n",
    "20) in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_status_id_str, in_reply_to_user_id, and in_reply_to_user_id_str are float and should be converted to integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "21) quoted_status_id should be an integer and seems to have very few records (26)\n",
    "\n",
    "22) quoted status_id_str should be an object/string \n",
    "\n",
    "23) The source is included in this file as well as twitter_archive_enhanced.  Drop \"source\" from cleaned_tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "24)  Remove the \"lang\" column.  It does not provide additional value to this study.  All tweets appear to be either english or jibberish.\n",
    "\n",
    "25) Remove the truncated column as the only value is \"False\".\n",
    "\n",
    "26) The text field contains two data elements (The rating response and the tweet URL.  The tweet URL should be separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidy Data Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In the twitter_archive_enhanced file: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) We can see that doggo has the value of doggo if the animal is identified in that stage, otherwise it is populated with None.  Best approach is to move doggo, puppo, pupper, and floofer under a single variable, called development_stage.  This eliminates additional variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In the tweet-json.txt file:\n",
    "\n",
    "2) tweets and twitter_archive_enhanced have the following duplicate column names: tweet_id, source, in_reply_to_status_id, and in_reply_to_user_id. Plan to delete keep tweet_id as it is common to all files and delete the in_reply_to_status_id and in_reply_to_user_id from the twitter_archive_enhanced file. tweets seems to have a fuller table and it makes sense it should go with that table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Remove the geo, coordinates, place and contributors columns becaues they provide little to no data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Remove the display_text_range column as it only provides the display text range\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Remove the entities column as it does not provide any data that will be used in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Drop is_quote_status as it does not add value to the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "7) The quoted_status_permalink does not appear to add value to the analysis.  "
